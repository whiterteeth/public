## Beliefs

### <a name="type-0"></a> Type 0: Metabeliefs
Beliefs about beliefs.

- Making and maintaining this document is useful and fun.
- It's purpose is to capture my beliefs about reality.
- This document is incomplete, and will always be a work-in-progress.
- Any of these beliefs may be proven wrong.
- I’m open to changing my mind at any time about any belief.
- I organize my beliefs as follows: metabeliefs (i.e. beliefs about beliefs), beliefs about the nature of reality, opinions about justice, and conjecture about the future.
- Behavior and belief are intimately linked:

> If you don't behave as you believe, you will end by believing as you behave.

– Ven. Fulton J. Sheen

### <a name="type-1"></a> Type 1: Beliefs
How reality seems to be. **1.1** is about human nature: how the mind and senses seem to work, **1.2** is about my take on spirituality, and **1.3** is about how I think the external world is based on the information I have.

#### 1.1 Beliefs on Human Nature
Personal mental and physical abilities, constraints, and biases.

- Perception/sensation is biased and limited.
- People do not *always* have complete agency (i.e. free-will)—as in the example of a drug addict or a compulsive gambler—nor are our actions always determined. The free-will/determinism dichotomy is a false one.
- As evidence for free-will: people have the capacity to do things of their own volition, even to change deep-seated habits (although this is almost always much harder than we imagine).
- People are limited in their ability to know themselves, both individually and as a group, culture, or species.
- People are not essentially rational or irrational. We have a well-developed brain affording reflective reasoning, though we also have vestiges of a faster, earlier-animal brain (Systems I & II, in the language of cognitive psychology).
- That rational or reflective part is powerful. It allows us to explore and learn a lot about the universe, find meaning, deduce truth, and change for the better or worse.
- Yet we also often use quicker cognitive systems–heuristics, biases, emotional impulses–that have their own value.
- Both systems have pitfalls.
- Our memory is biased for meaning, and we give our lives meaning with stories.
- Pure altruism is possible, but very difficult, if not practically impossible.
- People have a fundamentally selfish viewpoint. Often the only pertinent information in decisions is personal consequence.
- We also have a tendency to justify our actions. If a decision has unintended negative consequences, we are averse to taking responsibility for them.
- This selfishness and self-justification is the essential cause of what we call evil in the world.
- Human nature has been essentially the same for the past several thousand years, and will not change with merely shifting social mores (“progress”) or the development of technology.

##### Buster's ideas that I'm not sure what to do with (BITINSWTDW)

- We are all building an incomplete model of the universe in our heads and usually operate under the assumption that this model is the real universe (it’s just easier that way).
- Our mental model of the universe evolved so we could better predict and act on long-term threats and opportunities. 
- The best way for our brains to model predictions is to create stories.
- Consciousness is a stream of observer moments. 
- Each observer moment is a static model of the universe captured in freeze frame, with a frozen picture of the past, present, future, and every concept. It gets updated anew each moment, along with a fading memory of past moments.
- Consciousness is the sensation of our mental model of the universe constantly changing itself to integrate new information.
- Consciousness evolved to allow our mental model of the universe to examine, repair, and improve itself.
- Playing lots of games (of any kind: video, board, card, other) will make us build more accurate models of the universe than people who don’t.
- We tend to favor the beautiful, the reaffirming, and the expected.
- We tend to attribute too much credit to success (and under-credit luck).

#### 1.2 Metaphysical Beliefs
My take on the spiritual and supernatural.

- Our purpose is to glorify God. This can be done in many ways.
- Frequently remembering we will die increases the quality of our life.
- Life is already lost. The only honest way to approach it is from a perspective of gratitude.
- Souls don't exist as separate from the physical body.
- The existence of a universe (i.e. a creation) implies the existence of a creator.
- The creator of the universe is God (i.e. God the Father of the Christian Trinity).
- Intention can't create reality (it just primes our perception of it).
- Astrology is (fun) entertainment, like the Myers Briggs test.
- Magic and miracles don't exist outside the explanations of science.
- There is no heaven or hell.
- We have no cosmic significance.

#### 1.3 Epistemological Beliefs
Science, politics, and the universe.

> The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.
 
–John Milton

- All of the tools of epistemology (i.e. logic, empiricism, pragmatism, authority, revelation)—those things we use to get at truth—are helpful. But each have flaws and can't be relied on entirely.
- I affirm the claims about God and Jesus Christ expressed in the Nicene Creed.
- We probably live in a simulation (see digital realism).
- Other dimensions and universes exist.
- Micro and macro evolution happens.
- Something like the Big Bang happened, and will probably happen again.
- Something existed before the Big Bang (outside of time and space as we know them).
- Nothing in our universe can travel faster than light.
- The human brain (in its current state of evolution) can't comprehend the universe.
- Non-carbon-based life forms exist.
- Aliens exist, but we will most likely discover their creations (ie. robots they made) before we discover them. 
- Aliens will probably discover our own robots before they discover us.
- The vast majority of intelligent beings throughout the universe are probably more similar to robots and cyborgs than organically evolved life.
- Perception of time can be sped up or slowed down, but not reversed (forwards time travel is possible, backwards is not).
- Technology will eventually disrupt all other human-created institutions (politics, religion, identity, economics, energy).
- As history progresses, power will tend to be more quickly redistributed when it gets too heavy at the top.
- Privacy is just a side effect of people not being truly connected.
- Being good/moral increasingly becomes our default state as we learn more about the world and are more connected with others.
- Most questions have no answer (but asking them anyway is often entertaining).
- Acupuncture works, somehow.
- Vaccinations are good for babies and society.

### <a name="type-2"></a> Type 2: Opinions
Opinions about justice, i.e. how things ought to be. **2.1** is about what how one ought to approach life, and **2.2** is about how society ought to be structured.

#### 2.1 Deontological Opinions
How I believe I should approach life. These are all opt-in and apply only to myself.

- I should regularly verify that I want to continue opting-in to everything in this document on the first of every month. 
- I should create a new monthly report on the first of every month.
- I should create a new yearly report every year on my birthday.
- I should strive to know what I really believe, and to make sure my beliefs work well together.
- I should not dilly-dally.
- I should be my word.
- I should have good intentions.
- I should admit to being the maker of my own meaning.
- I should not feel sorry for myself and avoid competitive suffering.
- I should have a vision that I'm striving for.
- I should rally others with my vision.
- I should be the change I want to see.
- I should stake my reputation on my better self.
- I should be comfortable with the consequences of being who I am.
- I should make my own advice and take it.
- I should manage my stress, health, and clarity by consistently eating well, exercising, and getting enough sleep.
- I should study my mistakes.
- I should retry things I don’t like every once in a while.
- I should go slow, work hard, and avoid shortcuts.
- I should cultivate quality time with myself, with others, and with my interests.
- I should face things that make me uncomfortable.
- I should take responsibility for things I find important, even if I can’t fully control them.

#### 2.2 Political & Economical Opinions
How I believe society should be structured.

- Civil unions & holy matrimony (i.e. religious marriage) should be considered as separate though similar and often overlapping things.
- The death penalty is no longer necessary to protect society. When the death penalty is justified, vindictive retribution, which is harmful for society, is fueled. Furthermore, wrongful convictions still happen, leading to murder by the state. For these reasons, the death penalty should be indefinitely suspended.
- Prisons should protect the public and rehabilitate inmates; this may involve both punishment and better treatment.
- Marijuana should be legalized and regulated like alcohol; convicts serving sentences due to marijuana should be pardoned and released.
- Education should be available to everyone who wants it.

#### BITINSWTDW

- Abortion should be legal everywhere.
- Assisted suicide should be legal everywhere.
- Health care should be available and affordable to everyone who needs it.
- Owning a gun should require certification from a firearms officer verifying that they've taken a safety course, are free of criminal record, and pass a psychological mental health check every few years.
- It should be easier and more expedient to put neglectful and irresponsible public servants in prison than the average citizen, not slower and more difficult.
- Guaranteed basic income should be a thing available to everyone.
- Hunting endangered animals in order to raise money to conserve them is okay if it can be proven to actually work.

### <a name="type-3"></a> Type 3: Conjecture
How I think things will be in the future, based on the approximate year I think they’ll come true.

## Glossary
 
### <a name="what"></a> What is this?
This document was started in [April of 2012](https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/cb1481ae0d2458474d61d79cde6d9bef05a55a8c/Beliefs.md) by Buster Benson. I started my own in January, 2016. In the latter half of 2015, as the 2016 election cycle began, I decided to opt-out from the news and use the time to revisit my personal beliefs. I found that defining my political and social beliefs required greater clarification of beliefs about my personal duties, the nature of reality and the universe. In other words, I needed to start from the bottom up. And though I admire Benson's ideas and work, I part with him in many other ways here. Nevertheless, I think his framework does provide a model for how one should re-examine and present their beliefs.

So this is a way for me to learn about who I am, to catch inconsistencies in how I respond to ideas and events, to learn how to react to current events within the context of what I believe.

### <a name="codex"></a> Codex vitæ
Again, per [Buster Benson](http://wayoftheduck.com/codex-vitae):

> This is an idea coined by Robin Sloan in his book [Mr Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore](http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Penumbras-24-Hour-Bookstore-Novel/dp/1250037751). The idea is to write a book, the Codex Vitæ or Book of Life, that represents everything I have learned in my life. If I lost all of my memories somehow, this could be something that helped me remember who I am.
